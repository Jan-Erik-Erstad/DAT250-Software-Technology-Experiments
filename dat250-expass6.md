## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 6

#### Introduction

This is a two part experiment where we explore some front-end technologies. The first is a simple Spring MVC guide exploring the serving of web content. The second is a more comprehensive guide where we build a tick-tock game using react.
